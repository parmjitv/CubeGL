Hello All,

This is an implementation of the classic spinning cube for Windows, using the basic OpenGL primitives.

The project was developed with the Dev-C++ IDE (v4.9) and uses the MinGW port of the standard GCC compiler for Windows x86 systems:

http://www.mingw.org/

The executable 'cube_gl' provided will run under Windows 10 and should work for all previous 64-bit versions as well, but this has not been tested.

To compile the project from source requires the OpenGL header and archive libraries for Windows - gl.h and libopengl32.a are included with the MinGW distribution, or optionally they can be fetched from the GitHub repository:

Happy coding!
